Work Split:
In the comments, code/classes made by Steven are represented with SS and code/classes made by Jerry are represented with JZ.
Most classes have a comment saying who did most of the work in the class, or who did the entire class
Comments without SS or JZ means the guy who did most of the class wrote the code
